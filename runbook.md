# Runbook

This is the Skyscrapers alerts runbook (or playbook), inspired in the upstream [kubernetes-mixin own runbook](https://github.com/kubernetes-monitoring/kubernetes-mixin/blob/master/runbook.md).

In this page you should find detailed information about specific alerts comming from your monitoring system. It's possible though that some alerts haven't been documented yet or the information is incomplete or outdated. If you find a missing alert or inacurate information, feel free to submit an issue or pull request.

In addition to the alerts listed on this page, there are other system alerts that are described in upstream runbooks, like the one linked above. Always follow the `runbook_url` annotation link (:notebook:) in the alert notification to get the most recent and up-to-date information about that alert.

## Kubernetes alerts

### Alert Name: CalicoNodeInstanceDown

- *Description*: `{{$labels.instance}} of job {{$labels.job}} has been down for more than 5 minutes`
- *Severity*: `critical`
- *Action*: Check the `calico-node` Pods with `kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node` and look at the Pod logs using `kubectl logs -n kube-system <pod>` for further information.

### Alert Name: CalicoDataplaneFailures

- *Description*: `{{$labels.instance}} with calico-node pod {{$labels.pod}} has been having dataplane failures`
- *Severity*: `warning`
- *Action*: Check the `calico-node` Pods with `kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node` and look at the Pod logs using `kubectl logs -n kube-system <pod>` for further information.

### Alert Name: MemoryOvercommitted

- *Description*: `{{$labels.node}} is overcommited by {{$value}}%`
- *Severity*: `warning`
- *Action*: Check the actual memory usage of the cluster. If it's not too high it might indicate that Pod resource requests are not adjusted properly. Otherwise try adding more nodes to the cluster.

### Alert Name: CPUUsageHigh

- *Severity*: `critical`
- *Action*: Check the AWS Console which volumes are stuck in an `Attaching` state. Unattach the volume and delete the Pod the volume belongs to (most likely in `Pending` state) so it can be rescheduled on another node. Untaint the affected node when everything is OK again.

## ElasticSearch alerts

### Alert Name: ElasticsearchExporterDown

- *Description*: `The Elasticsearch metrics exporter for {{ $labels.job }} is down!`
- *Severity*: `critical`
- *Action*: Check the `elasticsearch-exporter` Pods with `kubectl get pods -n infrastructure -l app=elasticsearch-exporter,release=logging-es-monitor` and look at the Pod logs using `kubectl logs -n infrastructure <pod>` for further information.

### Alert Name: ElasticsearchCloudwatchExporterDown

- *Description*: `The Elasticsearch Cloudwatch metrics exporter for {{ $labels.job }} is down!`
- *Severity*: `critical`
- *Action*: Check the `cloudwatch-exporter` Pods with `kubectl get pods -n infrastructure -l app=prometheus-cloudwatch-exporter,release=logging-es-monitor` and look at the Pod logs using `kubectl logs -n infrastructure <pod>` for further information.

- *Severity*: `critical`

### Alert Name: ElasticsearchAWSLowDiskSpace

- *Description*: `AWS Elasticsearch cluster {{ $labels.cluster }} is low on free disk space`
- *Severity*: `warning`
- *Extended description*: the amount of free space is computed like `free_space / max(available_space, 100GB)`. So if an ES cluster has a disk size of 1TB, this alert will go off when the free space goes below 10GB. But if the disk size is 50GB, the alert will go off when the free space drops below 5GB.

### Alert Name: ElasticsearchAWSNoDiskSpace

- *Description*: `AWS Elasticsearch cluster {{ $labels.cluster }} has no free disk space`
- *Severity*: `critical`
- *Extended description*: the amount of free space is computed like `free_space / max(available_space, 100GB)`. So if an ES cluster has a disk size of 1TB, this alert will go off when the free space goes below 5GB. But if the disk size is 50GB, the alert will go off when the free space drops below 2.5GB.

### Alert Name: ElasticsearchIndexWritesBlocked

- *Description*: `AWS Elasticsearch cluster {{ $labels.cluster }} is blocking incoming write requests`
- *Severity*: `critical`
- *Extended description (from the [AWS official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-managedomains-cloudwatchmetrics.html#es-managedomains-cloudwatchmetrics-cluster-metrics))*: Indicates that the ES cluster is blocking incoming write requests. This alert is only available for AWS ElasticSearch clusters, as it's provided by the Cloudwatch exporter. Some common factors include the following: `FreeStorageSpace` is too low or `JVMMemoryPressure` is too high. To alleviate this issue, consider adding more disk space or scaling your cluster.

### Alert Name: ElasticsearchLowDiskSpace

- *Description*: `Elasticsearch node {{ $labels.node }} on cluster {{ $labels.cluster }} is low on free disk space`
- *Severity*: `warning`

### Alert Name: ElasticsearchNoDiskSpace

- *Description*: `Low connections available on {{$labels.instance}}`
- *Severity*: `warning`
- *Action*: The cluster is running out of connections to accept. This needs to be looked at. Try to find the cause of the buildup of queries (slow queries or something that is going crazy). If the node runs out of connections the replication can come into problems and cause the whole cluster to fail.

### Alert Name: MongodbUnhealthyMember

- *Description*: `A mongo node with issues has been detected on {{$labels.instance}}`
- *Severity*: `critical`

### Alert Name: MongodbReplicationLagWarning

### Alert Name: ExternalDnsRegistryErrorsIncrease

- *Description*: `External DNS registry Errors increasing constantly`
- *Severity*: `warning`
- *Action*: `Registry` errors are mostly Provider errors, unless there's some coding flaw in the registry package. Provider errors often arise due to accessing their APIs due to network or missing cloud-provider permissions when reading records. When applying a changeset, errors will arise if the changeset applied is incompatible with the current state. In case of an increased error count, you could correlate them with the `http_request_duration_seconds{handler="instrumented_http"}` metric which should show increased numbers for status codes 4xx (permissions, configuration, invalid changeset) or 5xx (apiserver down). You can use the host label in the metric to figure out if the request was against the Kubernetes API server (Source errors) or the DNS provider API (Registry/Provider errors).

### Alert Name: ExternalDNSSourceErrorsIncrease

- *Description*: `External DNS source Errors increasing constantly`
- *Severity*: `warning`
- *Action*: `Source`s are mostly Kubernetes API objects. Examples of `source` errors may be connection errors to the Kubernetes API server itself or missing RBAC permissions. It can also stem from incompatible configuration in the objects itself like invalid characters, processing a broken fqdnTemplate, etc. In case of an increased error count, you could correlate them with the `http_request_duration_seconds{handler="instrumented_http"}` metric which should show increased numbers for status codes 4xx (permissions, configuration, invalid changeset) or 5xx (apiserver down). You can use the host label in the metric to figure out if the request was against the Kubernetes API server (Source errors) or the DNS provider API (Registry/Provider errors).
