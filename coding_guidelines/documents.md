# Documents

## Document naming

If you create documents in any form, make sure you follow the following
guidelines:

- Title with
  - Date or period
  - Clear description of contents
  - Customer name if applicable
  - Work issue (GH/PD/etc) reference if applicable
- Document contents should be the same as the title
- If possible, use Skyscrapers branding (use one of the templates)
- All documents that leave Skyscrapers need the Skyscrapers branding and reference on it

Some examples for the title:

- `20180607 Project plan for  XYZ GH#XYZ#123`
- `20180720 XYZ Proposal PD#123`
