# Skyscrapers products & services documentation

This repository contains user-level documentation for our product & service offering, as well as documentation on tools and best practices. The main target audience of this knowledge-base are the Skyscrapers customers.

In this knowledge base you'll find information on how to use your Kubernetes cluster, how to create a Concourse pipeline, how to manage containerized applications and how to monitor them, etc. It's intended to be browsed mainly through GitHub or a local git clone, so the file tree acts as the table of contents.
