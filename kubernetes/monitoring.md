# Kubernetes monitoring

We use a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) stack for a complete monitoring setup of both the Kubernetes cluster itself and applications running on it.

- Prometheus does the _service monitoring_ and keeps time-series data. There's one for the cluster monitoring and another one for monitoring your applications.
- Alertmanager is responsible for handling alerts, based on _rules_ from Prometheus. In our case Alertmanager is responsible for making sure alerts end up in [Opsgenie](https://www.opsgenie.com/) and Slack.
- Grafana provides nice charts and dashboards of the Prometheus time-series data.

We make use of the CoreOS _operator_ principle: by deploying [prometheus-operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator) we define new Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) for `Prometheus`, `Alertmanager`, `ServiceMonitor` and `PrometheusRule` which are responsible for deploying Prometheus and Alertmanager setups, Prometheus scrape targets and alerting rules, respectively.

As of this writing there isn't an operator setup yet for Grafana, but you can add custom dashboards dynamically via `ConfigMaps`.

## Kubernetes application monitoring

By default we create an `application-monitoring` namespace where you can deploy your application's `ServiceMonitors` and `PrometheusRules` and these new configs will be picked up automatically by Prometheus. The only extra requirement is that these resources also need a `prometheus` label set (any value will do).

If you wish, it is also possible to include any other namespace to be searched for Prometheus configs by adding a `prometheus` label to the namespace (any value will do). For example: `kubectl label namespace default prometheus=true`.

Custom Grafana Dashboards can also be added to this same namespace by creting a `ConfigMap` with a `grafana_dashboard` label (any value will do), containing the dashboard's json data. Please make sure that `"datasources"` are set to `"Prometheus"` in your dashboards!

*Note: even if these objects are created in the `application-monitoring` namespace, Prometheus can scrape metric targets in all namespaces.*

### Example ServiceMonitor

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    prometheus: application-monitor
  name: myapplication-php-fpm-exporter
  namespace: application-monitoring
spec:
  endpoints:
    - targetPort: 8080
      interval: 30s
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
      - production
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: application
      component: php
```

You can find more examples in the official [Prometheus Operator documentation](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/tree/master/Documentation/user-guides)

### Example PrometheusRule

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  labels:
    prometheus: application-monitor
  name: myapplication-alert-rules
  namespace: application-monitoring
spec:
  groups:
  - name: myapplication.rules
    rules:
    - alert: MyApplicationPhpFpmDown
      expr: phpfpm_up{job="application"} == 0
      for: 10m
      labels:
        severity: critical
        client: MyCompanyName
      annotations:
        description: '{{`{{ $value }}`}}% of {{`{{ $labels.job }}`}} PHP-FPM are down!'
        summary: PHP-FPM down
```

You can find more examples in the official [Prometheus Operator documentation](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/tree/master/Documentation/user-guides)

### Example Grafana Dashboard

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
    grafana_dashboard: application-monitor
  name: grafana-dashboard-myapplication
  namespace: application-monitoring
data:
  grafana-dashboard-myapplication.json: |
{ <Grafana dashboard json> }
```

### Prometheus scrapers for common technologies

Here's a list of Prometheus scrapers already available for common frameworks.

#### PHP

##### Native

Prometheus has a [native client library](https://github.com/Jimdo/prometheus_client_php) for PHP. This is easy to implement inside your application, but by default doesn't expose standard metrics. This is ideal if you want to expose your own metrics (can also be business metrics).

##### PHP-FPM

If you want to get PHP-FPM metrics, we recommend using [this exporter](https://github.com/hipages/php-fpm_exporter). It's being actively maintained and the documentation is reasonably good. You have to setup the exporter as a sidecar container in your pods, then it'll access the PHP-FPM socket to read statistics and expose them as Prometheus metrics.

You first need to expose the metrics in PHP-FPM. You can do this by adding the following config your PHP-FPM image.

```
pm.status_path = /status
```

Then you'll need to add the `php-fpm-exporter` as a sidecar container to your pod, like this:

```
        - name: {{ template "app.fullname" . }}-fpm-exporter
          image: "hipages/php-fpm_exporter:0.5.2"
          command: ["--phpfpm.scrape-uri", "tcp://127.0.0.1:{{ .Values.app.port }}/status"]
          ports:
            - name: prom
              containerPort: 9253
              protocol: TCP
          livenessProbe:
            tcpSocket:
              port: prom
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            periodSeconds: 5
          readinessProbe:
            tcpSocket:
              port: prom
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            timeoutSeconds: 5
```

*Note that you'll need to adjust `{{ template "app.fullname" . }}` and `{{ .Values.app.port }}` to the correct helm variables. The first one represents the app name we want to monitor. The second is the php-fpm port of the application.*

After that, you can add a `ServiceMonitor` to scrape it.

#### Ruby

##### Native

Prometheus has a [native client library](https://github.com/prometheus/client_ruby) for Ruby. This is a really good library when you run your ruby application as single process. Unfortunately a lot of applications use Unicorn or another multi-process integration. When using a multi-process Ruby you can best use the [fork](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/prometheus-client-mmap) of GitLab.

You have to integrate this library in your application and expose it as an endpoint. Once that is done, you can add a `ServiceMonitor` to scrape it.

##### Workers

Workers by default don't expose a webserver to scrape from. This will have to change and every worker will need to expose a simple webserver so that Prometheus can scrape its metrics.

It is really discouraged to use Pushgateway for this. For more info why this is discouraged, see the [Pushgateway documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/pushing/#should-i-be-using-the-pushgateway).

#### Nginx

Nginx has an exporter through the [Nginx VTS module](https://github.com/vozlt/nginx-module-vts). We [forked](https://github.com/skyscrapers/docker-images/tree/master/nginx) the official Docker Nginx image and added the VTS module to nginx. We had to fork it because the VTS module needs to be compiled with Nginx.

##### Setup

1. Use our [Nginx](https://hub.docker.com/r/skyscrapers/nginx/) Docker image instead of the upstream Nginx.
2. Add the [exporter](https://github.com/hnlq715/nginx-vts-exporter) as sidecar to the pod.

```
        - name: {{ template "app.fullname" . }}-exporter
          image: "sophos/nginx-vts-exporter:v0.10.0"
          env:
            - name: NGINX_STATUS
              value: http://localhost:9999/status/format/json
          ports:
            - name: prom
              containerPort: 9913
```

*Note that you will need to adjust `{{ template "app.fullname" . }}` to the correct helm variables. It represents the app name you want to monitor.*

After that, you can add a `ServiceMonitor` to scrape it.

## Default alerts

This is a list of all the alerts that are configured by default in your Kubernetes cluster.
