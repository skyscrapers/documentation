## Skyscrapers Support Process

### Priorities

We handle service requests via 3 main priority categories:

- **Prio 1: Now (<30min)**: only 24/7 production incidents
- **Prio 2: Today**
- **Prio 3: To be planned**

- **Prio 1: Now (<30min)**
	- Only 24/7 incidents "production hampered" → Use the [escalation process](#escalation-process)
- **Prio 2: Today**
	- You are stuck: breaking bugs, because feature X is not working or not implemented correctly
	  → Create GitHub issue, notify via Slack `@help`
	- Small guidance questions (where do I find..., how do I use...) → notify via Slack `@help`
- **Prio 3: To be planned**
	- All the rest (so everything that doesn't need to be resolved right now)
	  → Handled via GitHub issue(s), weekly status call and/or planned meeting with your Lead Engineer
  Examples:
  - Non-breaking bugs
  - New features / implementations
  - Queries for advice, design choices,...
  - Queries for technical information
  - Queries for non-technical information (contract, SLA, ...)
