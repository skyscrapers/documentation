# Skyscrapers Support Process

## Priorities

We handle service requests via 3 main priority categories:

### Prio 1: Now (<30min)
- Only 24/7 incidents "production hampered" → Use your dedicated 24/7 escalation number, as mentioned in your documentation, to page the on-call engineer
### Prio 2: Today
- You are stuck: breaking bugs, because feature X is not working or not implemented correctly → Create GitHub issue, notify via Slack `@help`
- Small guidance questions (where do I find..., how do I use...) → notify via Slack `@help`
### Prio 3: To be planned
- All the rest (so everything that doesn't need to be resolved right now)  → Handled via GitHub issue(s), weekly status call and/or planned meeting with your Lead Engineer.

  Examples:
  - Non-breaking bugs
  - New features / implementations
  - Queries for advice, design choices,...
  - Queries for technical information
  - Queries for non-technical information (contract, SLA, ...)
