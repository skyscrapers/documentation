# Skyscrapers Support Process
## Priorities
We handle service requests via 3 main categories: Production down, urgent, and non-urgent. Below is the expected response time for each category, what channel to use for it and when to use it:

|    |                             Production down (P1)                            |                                  Urgent                                 |                           Non-urgent                          |

## Communication channels
We maintain multiple channels to interact with us. Each has its strengths, depending on the type of request and priority.
