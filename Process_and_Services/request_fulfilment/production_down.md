# Production down procedure
If production is hampered and/or down, please use the automated number which is available in the main README file. 

- Clearly state your name and describe the problem.
- Our 24/7 on-call engineer is automatically alerted.
- The engineer will acknowledge the problem and take the first steps towards a solution. 
- The on-call engineer will notify you when everything is resolved


In case of major downtime caused by the hosting platform, we will produce a post-mortem document (within ~3 days after the outage resolution)
