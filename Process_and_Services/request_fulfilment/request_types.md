# Support & change request types
In this section of the documentation we will guide you through the process of creating a support or change request for Skyscrapers.

## Customer Lead
At Skyscrapers you have a dedicated customer lead for your project. This person is the end-2-end owner of your project and is responsible for ensuring alignment of our internal priorities and efforts with your (contracted) needs. 

For any concern, planning challenge or question... this is your go-to person that will make the magic happen.

The customer lead will be in touch with you - on a day-to-day basis and in regular status calls - to discuss your support and change requests. They will also provide you with the necessary information about their status and - if needed - they will also collaborate with you in re-aligning on priorities, timing and scope of the issues to ensure expectations are realistic and needs are met.
