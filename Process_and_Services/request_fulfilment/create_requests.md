# How should I create a request
When looking for a solution to a problem, you can create a request by using the dedicated GitHub board, by using the dedicated Slack channel, or by simply talking to your Customer Lead. Each of these methods comes with its own set of advantages (and sometimes requirements).

| Channel                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Priority requirement |

| **GitHub dashboard**                 | When created, any request made by a team member in your organisation will be available on your dedicated GitHub board. This is the single point of truth for both our teams and your team members. This board will be provide you with the necessary information on planning, progress and delivery status ... and it will obviously also allow you to create new requests for our team. <br/> <br/> More details on how to use the dashboard when following up on issues can be found [here](follow_up_on_requests.md). | All requests         |
| **Status calls**                     | Your Customer Lead will schedule regulare status calls throughout our collaboration. During these calls both the existing issues will be discussed and new needs might surface. On the back of these calls, your customer lead will make sure that all requests end up on your GitHub board for further follow-up.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | All requests |
| **Dedicated Slack channel workflow** | When an _Urgent_ issue (cfr. [Priorities](request_priorities.md)) pops up, we have enabled you to to reach out to us by using the _/Skyscrapers help_ workflow (or the Workflow button when part of an external Slack organisation) in your dedicated Slack channel. By doing so, you will automatically create a support request with priority Urgent (cfr. [Priorities](request_priorities.md) and our teams will be alerted.                                                                                          | Urgent and higher    |
| **Escalation number**                | In case of a _Production Down_ event (cfr. [Priorities](request_priorities.md)), we are just a phone call away using the dedicated escalation number. This will instantly activate our engineers to resolve the issue as soon as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Production down only |
